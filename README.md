# Genetics üß¨ üíª
Programming project of the subject Computer Architecture given in second year of Computer Science Engineering in UPV/EHU.

### Warning!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è
The execute may not be the same as the given ones in res1000.out and res.out. 
We do use a random number generator function and the fucntioning of this may depend on the compiler that you are using.

## Serial version (vserie)  
We developed the serial version of the program and some scripts to execute the program faster.

#### Code
The main functions that we have code are:
- **gendist(*elem 1, *elem2)**: Function to calculate vseries distance between two elements (Euclidean distance).
- **grupo_cercano(nelem, elem[][NCAR], cent[][NCAR], *popul)**: Function to calculate the closest cluster (closest centroid).
- **calcular_densidad(elem[][NCAR], *listag, *densidad)**: Function to calculate the density of the group (average distance between all its elements).
- **analizar_enfermedades (*listag, enf[][TENF], *prob_enf)**: Function to perform disease analysis.

#### Scripts
You can use this two basic scripts to compile and execute the code faster.
- **execvserie1000** is a script with running permissions to compile and execute the serial version with the amount of 1000 data. This way we can check that our programm is working correctly in 0.5 - 3 seconds.
- **execvserie** is a script with running permissions to compile and execute the serial version with the total amount of data.



## Parallel version (vparallel)
This version will be faster than the serial version, because we are distributing some tasks in different threads that can be computed simultaneously.
